The test creates a `ShapeList` object, sets some shapes in it, and then serializes it to a byte array using an `ObjectOutputStream`.

Finally, it checks if the original and deserialized objects are equal.\n\nThe test failure indicates that the expected and actual objects are not equal. Looking at the error message, we can see that the expected object is `org.jfree.chart.util.ShapeList@10100cc3` and the actual object is `org.jfree.chart.util.ShapeList@a88ac60e`.

The code snippet provided shows that this method simply calls `defaultWriteObject()` to serialize the object, and then writes out the number of shapes in the list and their indices. However, it does not seem to do anything with the actual shape objects themselves.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the bug is likely occurring during the serialization or deserialization process, specifically when dealing with the shape objects.
