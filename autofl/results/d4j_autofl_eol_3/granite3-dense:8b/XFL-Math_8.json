The `DiscreteDistribution` class is being instantiated with a list containing pairs of objects and doubles, and then attempting to call the `sample` method with an argument of 1.\n\nThe `sample` method is defined in the `DiscreteDistribution` class, as shown by the code snippet retrieved using the `get_code_snippet` function. The method iterates through the probabilities array and returns the object corresponding to the sampled index. However, the error message suggests that the method is attempting to store an object in the returned array where only double values are expected.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that the issue lies in the way the `DiscreteDistribution` class is being instantiated and used in the test method. The class expects a list of pairs containing an object and its corresponding double value, but the test method is passing a list containing pairs of objects and doubles. This mismatch in data types is likely causing the `ArrayStoreException` to occur.\n\nTo fix this issue, the test method should be updated to pass a list containing pairs of objects and their corresponding double values to the `DiscreteDistribution` class.
