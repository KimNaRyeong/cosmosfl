However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that the `BrentSolver` is used to find the event time, but it fails with an error message indicating that the function values at the endpoints do not have different signs. This suggests that the event time is not being calculated correctly.\n\nUpon further investigation, we find that the `EventState` class uses a `BrentSolver` to find the event time by solving for the root of the equation `g(t) = 0`, where `g(t)` is the function defined in the `EventHandler`. In this case, `g(t) = (t - r1) * (r2 - t)`. However, the `BrentSolver` fails because the function values at the endpoints do not have different signs.\n\nTo understand why this is happening, we can look at the code that sets up the event state and the interpolator. We find that the `EventState` is initialized with the `EventHandler` that defines the function `g(t)`, and the interpolator is set up to store times at `t0` and `0.5 * (r1 + r2)`. However, the `BrentSolver` is called with the endpoints `[89.999, 153.1]`, which are not the same as the times stored in the interpolator. This suggests that the event time is not being calculated correctly.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `BrentSolver` is called with the correct endpoints. One way to do this is to set the endpoints based on the times stored in the interpolator. We can do this by modifying the code that calls the `EventState` methods to set the endpoints correctly.\n\nHere are the suggested methods to fix:\n\n1. `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.evaluateStep(AbstractStepInterpolator)`: This method is called to evaluate the step and find the event time.
