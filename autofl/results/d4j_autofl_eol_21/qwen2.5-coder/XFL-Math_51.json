It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature).

However, the test failure indicates that the solver is exceeding its evaluation limit before finding a root. The error message points to a `TooManyEvaluationsException`, which means the solver has reached its maximum number of allowed evaluations without converging to a solution.\n\nFollowing the execution path, we find that `RegulaFalsiSolver` is attempting to solve for the root of the function `f(x) = e^x - \u03c0^3` within the interval `[1, 10]`. The solver uses an iterative method to approximate the root and has a default maximum number of evaluations set to 3,624. In this case, the solver is not converging to a solution within these limits, leading to the error.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the function `f(x)` does not have a root in the interval `[1, 10]`, or it takes an excessively long time to converge, causing the solver to exceed its evaluation limit. The function `f(x) = e^x - \u03c0^3` is always positive for all real numbers `x`, as `e^x` grows exponentially and is greater than `\u03c0^3` (which is approximately 314.159) for any `x > 0`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we should adjust the interval or increase the maximum number of evaluations allowed by the solver.\n\n```\nConclusion: The test `RegulaFalsiSolverTest.testIssue631` checks whether the `RegulaFalsiSolver` can correctly find a root for a given univariate real function within specified intervals.
