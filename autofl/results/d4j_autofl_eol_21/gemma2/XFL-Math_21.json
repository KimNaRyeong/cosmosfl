However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n3. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field. It returns the comment/documentation for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_comments(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n\nTo make a function call, respond like the following:\n\n```\nFunction call: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n```\n\nIf you are done and ready to generate a response, respond like the following:\n\n```\nConclusion: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks...\n```\n\nYou will keep these instructions in mind while proceeding.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

While this doesn't fix the underlying issue, it might allow the test to pass if the error is small enough.\n\n3. **Investigate Matrix Properties:** Use mathematical analysis or library functions to check if `m3` has any problematic properties (e.g., near-singularity, high condition number) that could be affecting the Cholesky decomposition.\n\n4. **Check for Numerical Libraries:** Ensure you're using a reliable numerical computing library (like Apache Commons Math, NumPy in Python) and that it's configured correctly.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!"
