However, the test failure indicates that the serialization process does not preserve the state of the `ShapeList` object. Specifically, the test compares two `ShapeList` objects (`l1` and `l2`) after deserialization to check if they are equal, but they are not.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to how the `ShapeList` class handles serialization. The `ShapeList` class does not have a custom serialization method (like `writeObject` and `readObject`), so Java's default serialization mechanism is used. However, since `ShapeList` contains `Shape` objects, which are likely not serializable by default, the deserialization process results in new instances of `Shape` with different memory addresses.\n\nTo fix this issue, you would need to implement custom serialization methods for the `ShapeList` class to ensure that all `Shape` objects are correctly serialized and deserialized."
