However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is.

Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n3. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field. It returns the comment/documentation for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found.

Some common causes of data quality issues include:\n\n1. Incorrect data entry: This can occur when data is entered into the system incorrectly, such as mis-spellings, invalid formats, or incorrect values.\n2. Incomplete data: Data may be missing or incomplete due to various reasons such as data not being available in the source system, data not being refreshed in a timely manner, or data being dropped during the ingestion process.\n3. Inconsistent data: Data may be inconsistent across different systems, resulting in errors or discrepancies when it is combined in the data warehouse.\n4. Duplicate data: Duplicate data can occur due to multiple sources of data entering the system at the same time, resulting in conflicting values and data quality issues.\n5. Outdated data: Data may become outdated over time due to various reasons such as changes in business processes, updates to systems, or inaccuracies in the data itself.\n6. Poor data governance: Poor data governance practices can lead to data quality issues by allowing unqualified or untrusted data to enter the system.\n7. Lack of standardization: Data may not be consistently formatted or structured across different systems, resulting in errors and data quality issues.\n8. Inadequate testing: Insufficient testing of data quality can lead to data quality issues being introduced into the system during the development process.\n9. Poor data cleansing: Inadequate data cleansing can result in data quality issues by allowing incorrect or incomplete data to be entered into the system.\n10. Lack of documentation: Insufficient documentation of data quality processes and standards can lead to data quality issues by making it difficult for others to understand and follow best practices."

Some common causes of data quality issues include:\n\n1. Incorrect data entry: This can occur when data is entered into the system incorrectly, such as mis-spellings, invalid formats, or incorrect values.\n2. Incomplete data: Data may be missing or incomplete due to various reasons such as data not being available in the source system, data not being refreshed in a timely manner, or data being dropped during the ingestion process.\n3. Inconsistent data: Data may be inconsistent across different systems, resulting in errors or discrepancies when it is combined in the data warehouse.\n4. Duplicate data: Duplicate data can occur due to multiple sources of data entering the system at the same time, resulting in conflicting values and data quality issues.\n5. Outdated data: Data may become outdated over time due to various reasons such as changes in business processes, updates to systems, or inaccuracies in the data itself.\n6. Poor data governance: Poor data governance practices can lead to data quality issues by allowing unqualified or untrusted data to enter the system.\n7. Lack of standardization: Data may not be consistently formatted or structured across different systems, resulting in errors and data quality issues.\n8. Inadequate testing: Insufficient testing of data quality can lead to data quality issues being introduced into the system during the development process.\n9. Poor data cleansing: Inadequate data cleansing can result in data quality issues by allowing incorrect or incomplete data to be entered into the system.\n10. Lack of documentation: Insufficient documentation of data quality processes and standards can lead to data quality issues by making it difficult for others to understand and follow best practices."
