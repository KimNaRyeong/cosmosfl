The test was calling the `FieldUtils.safeMultiply` method with two arguments: `Long.MIN_VALUE` and `-1`.\n\nBased on the error message and call stack, it appears that the `safeMultiply` method is throwing an `ArithmeticException` when the product of the two arguments overflows a long value. This means that the result of multiplying `Long.MIN_VALUE` by `-1` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a long integer, causing the exception to be thrown.\n\nTo fix this error, you could try changing the implementation of the `safeMultiply` method to handle overflows more gracefully. For example, you could use the `BigInteger` class to perform the multiplication and handle the result as a big integer value, which can represent larger numbers than a long integer. This would allow you to avoid the error message and make the test pass.\n\nAlternatively, you could also try changing the test case to provide smaller arguments that do not cause an overflow when multiplied together. For example, if the test is only checking for a specific behavior in certain cases, you could modify the test to provide smaller input values that do not trigger the error. This would allow you to make the test pass without modifying the `safeMultiply` method.\n\nOverall, it's important to carefully review the test case and consider the requirements of the test before making any changes to the code."
