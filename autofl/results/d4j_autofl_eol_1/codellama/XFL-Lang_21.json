This method takes two Calendar objects as input and checks if they represent the same local time, regardless of their time zones.\n\nBased on the error message \"LANG-677\", it seems that the test expects the two Calendar objects to be in the same time zone, but this is not what the code is doing. The test is comparing the two Calendars as if they were in different time zones, which results in a failure.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that the two Calendars are in the same time zone before comparing them. One way to do this is by using the `TimeZone.getTimeZone()` method to set the time zone of both Calendars to the same value. For example:\n```java\n// Assuming cal1 and cal2 are the Calendar objects being compared\ncal1.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"GMT+1\")); // Set the time zone for cal1\ncal2.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"GMT+1\")); // Set the time zone for cal2\nassertTrue(DateUtils.isSameLocalTime(cal1, cal2)); // This should now pass\n```\nBy setting both Calendars to have the same time zone, we ensure that they are in the same local time and can be compared correctly."
