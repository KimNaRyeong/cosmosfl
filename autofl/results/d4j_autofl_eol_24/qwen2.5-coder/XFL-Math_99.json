The LCM calculation involves multiplying the absolute values of the inputs and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD). If either input is zero, the LCM is considered zero.\n\nThe issue in the test arises because the multiplication operation in the `lcm` method can potentially overflow when dealing with large numbers like `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. The method `mulAndCheck(int, int)` is expected to handle such cases by throwing an `ArithmeticException` if the result overflows. However, the provided code snippet does not include this check for multiplication overflow.\n\nThe test expects an `ArithmeticException` to be thrown when `MathUtils.lcm(Integer.MIN_VALUE, 1)` is called, but it does not occur because the method does not perform a check for overflow in the multiplication step.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `mulAndCheck(int, int)` method includes a check for multiplication overflow.
