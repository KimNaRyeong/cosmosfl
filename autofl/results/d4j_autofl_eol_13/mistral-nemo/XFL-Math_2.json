You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test. It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n2. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n3. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field. It returns the comment/documentation for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_comments(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n\nTo make a function call, respond like the following:\n\n```\nFunction call: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n```\n\nIf you are done and ready to generate a response, respond like the following:\n\n```\nConclusion: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks...\n```\n\nYou will keep these instructions in mind while proceeding.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

However, the error message indicates that a sample with value `-49` was generated, which is outside this valid range.\n\nFollowing the execution path, we find that the `sample()` method of the `HypergeometricDistribution` class calls `inverseCumulativeProbability(random.nextDouble())`. The documentation for this method states: \"Returns the value corresponding to a probability between 0 and 1.\"\n\nHowever, since the `random.nextDouble()` method can generate values as low as 0.0 (but never below), it's unlikely that it would return a negative number. Therefore, the issue seems to be with the implementation of `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)` method in the `AbstractIntegerDistribution` class.\n\nUpon examining the code snippet for this method, we see that it's returning the result of a floor division operation `(int) (p * size)`, where `size` is a protected field. Since `size` can be zero (as seen in the test case where `n = 50`), the division by zero occurs, leading to an `ArithmeticException`. However, this exception isn't being caught or handled properly, causing the test to fail.\n\nConclusion: The test `testMath1021` checks whether samples generated by the `HypergeometricDistribution.sample()` method fall within the valid range [0, n]. However, a sample with value `-49` was generated due to an unhandled `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero in the `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)` method of the `AbstractIntegerDistribution` class.\n\nMethods to be fixed:\norg.apache.commons.math3.distribution.AbstractIntegerDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability(double)"
