However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case.

The method compares two fractions, but it seems that one of the fractions might be equal to the other, leading to a comparison result of 0 instead of -1.\n\nLet's analyze the code snippet for `Fraction.compareTo()`:\n\n```java\n258 :     public int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n259 :         double nOd = doubleValue();\n260 :         double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n261 :         return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n262 :     }\n```\n\nThe method converts both fractions to their double representations and then compares them. If the double values are equal, it returns 0, which is not expected in this case.\n\nThe test uses two fractions that are supposed to be different approximations of PI but might actually be equal due to precision issues. The first fraction `pi1` is approximately `PI - 3.07e-18`, and the second fraction `pi2` is approximately `PI + 1.936e-17`. Given these values, it's possible that due to floating-point arithmetic, `pi1` and `pi2` might be considered equal.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that the fractions are compared correctly, taking into account potential precision issues. One way to do this is by using a tolerance value when comparing the double representations of the fractions.\n\nHere are the methods that would be best locations to be fixed:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.fraction.Fraction.compareTo(org.apache.commons.math.fraction.Fraction)\n```"
