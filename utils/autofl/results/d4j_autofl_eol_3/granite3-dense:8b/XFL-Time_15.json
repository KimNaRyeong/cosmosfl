It checks if the result of the multiplication (`total`) divided by the second operand (`val2`) equals the first operand (`val1`). If they are not equal, it throws the exception. In this case, the second operand is `-1`, so the division should always be different from the first operand, causing the exception to be thrown. However, the test failure suggests that the exception is not being thrown, indicating a bug in the `safeMultiply` method.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to investigate why the exception is not being thrown when it should be. We can start by checking if the division operation is correctly implemented and if the condition for throwing the exception is met. If the division operation is correct, we may need to look into other parts of the code that might be preventing the exception from being thrown.\n\nSuggested methods to fix:\n\n1. `org.joda.time.field.FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long, int)`"
