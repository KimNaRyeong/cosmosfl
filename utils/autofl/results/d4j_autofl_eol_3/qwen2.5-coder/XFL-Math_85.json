Your task is to provide a step-by-step explanation of how the bug occurred, based on the failing test and the information you retrieved using tools about the SUT. You will be given 9 chances to interact with functions to gather relevant information. An example answer would look like follows.\n\n```\nThe test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks whether HTML entities such as `&quot;` are correctly escaped to their corresponding character by the `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` method. However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n```\n\nYou have the following functions available to debug the case:\n\n1. get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(class_name) - This function takes a class_name as input and returns a list of method names covered by failing tests for the specified class in the program under test. It returns a list of truncated method signatures (add to the class name to get the full signature). Call example: get_failing_tests_covered_methods_for_class(\"my.favorite.Class\")\n2. get_code_snippet(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns the corresponding code snippet for the method or field. It returns the code snippet for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n3. get_comments(method_signature) - This function takes a signature as input and returns JavaDoc documentation (if available) for the method or field. It returns the comment/documentation for the specified method or field, or the error message if the signature is not found. Call example: get_comments(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n\nTo make a function call, respond like the following:\n\n```\nFunction call: get_code_snippet(\"my.favorite.Class.Method(Args)\")\n```\n\nIf you are done and ready to generate a response, respond like the following:\n\n```\nConclusion: The test `testGenerateURLFragment` checks...\n```\n\nYou will keep these instructions in mind while proceeding.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed.

This is due to the fact that the initial bounds and step size are causing the solver to converge too quickly or become stuck. The test passes with a small probability because the input value is close to the expected result.\n\nThe bug occurs in the `NormalDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability` method, which uses a root-finding algorithm to compute the inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF). The failure indicates that the solver is not handling the initial bounds and step size correctly, causing it to exceed the maximum number of iterations allowed by default.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try one or more of the following approaches:\n\n1. **Increase the Maximum Number of Iterations**: You can increase the `maxIterations` parameter in the root-finding algorithm to allow for more iterations.\n2. **Adjust Initial Guess and Bounds**: Adjust the initial guess and bounds used by the solver to ensure they are closer to the expected solution.\n3. **Change Solver Algorithm**: Consider using a different root-finding algorithm that may be more robust for this type of problem.\n\nHere is an example of how you might adjust the `maxIterations` parameter:\n\n```java\npublic double inverseCumulativeProbability(double p) throws ConvergenceException, MaxIterationsExceededException {\n    if (p <= 0 || p >= 1) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"p must be strictly between 0 and 1\");\n    }\n\n    UnivariateRealFunction f = new UnivariateRealFunction() {\n        public double value(double x) {\n            return cumulativeProbability(x) - p;\n        }\n    };\n\n    BrentSolver solver = new BrentSolver();\n    solver.setMaxIterations(1000); // Increase the maximum number of iterations\n    return solver.solve(100, f, 0, 2);\n}\n```\n\nBy increasing the `maxIterations` parameter, you allow the solver more time to converge on a solution.
