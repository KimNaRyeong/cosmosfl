However, the test failure indicates that the translation method is not working as expected. Specifically, the error message `Incorrect codepoint consumption expected:<3> but was:<0>` suggests that the method did not consume any characters during the translation process.\n\nFrom the provided code snippet of `LookupTranslator.translate`, we can see that the method iterates over possible substrings starting from the given index and attempts to find a match in the lookup map. If a match is found, it writes the replacement text to the output writer and returns the number of characters consumed. However, if no matches are found for any substring length, it returns 0.\n\nThe test expects at least three characters to be consumed during the translation, as indicated by the expected value `3`. Since the method returned `0`, this means that none of the substrings from index `0` onwards were found in the lookup map. The failure suggests that either the lookup map does not contain the expected mapping or the input sequence is incorrect.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that the lookup map contains the correct mappings for the substrings being tested and that the input sequence is correctly formatted. Additionally, we may want to verify that the method handles different edge cases, such as empty strings or very long strings that do not match any entries in the lookup map.\n\nConclusion: The test `testLang882()` checks whether the `LookupTranslator.translate` method correctly translates a given input sequence by replacing specified substrings. However, the test failure indicates that the method did not consume any characters during the translation process, leading to an incorrect codepoint consumption value of `0`.
