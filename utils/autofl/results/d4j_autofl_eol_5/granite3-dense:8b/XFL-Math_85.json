The failure message indicates that the method is not converging within the maximum number of iterations allowed, which is causing the `ConvergenceException` to be thrown.\n\nTo understand why this is happening, we can start by looking at the implementation of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method in the `NormalDistributionImpl` class. This method uses a numerical algorithm to find the inverse cumulative probability of a normal distribution, which can be computationally intensive and may not always converge within the specified number of iterations.\n\nOne possible reason for the failure is that the initial guess for the root of the equation being solved is too far from the actual root, causing the algorithm to take many iterations to converge. Another possibility is that the function being solved is not well-behaved in the region around the expected root, making it difficult for the algorithm to find the correct solution.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, we can look at the values of the variables `a` and `b` used in the `ConvergenceException` message. These values represent the lower and upper bounds of the interval being searched for the root, respectively. If these bounds are too far apart or not well-chosen, it could be causing the algorithm to fail to converge within the maximum number of iterations.\n\nTo fix this issue, we could try adjusting the initial guess or the bounds of the search interval used in the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method. We could also consider using a different numerical algorithm or implementing additional checks to ensure that the function being solved is well-behaved in the region around the expected root."
