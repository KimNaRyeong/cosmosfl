The test creates a linear objective function and a set of constraints, then attempts to solve the problem using the `SimplexSolver`. The solution should ensure that all variables are non-negative.\n\nThe failure occurred at line 43 in the method `testMath713NegativeVariable`, where an assertion failed because one of the variables in the solution was negative.
