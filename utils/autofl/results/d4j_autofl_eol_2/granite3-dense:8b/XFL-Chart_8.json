However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case.

The test fails because the expected week number (35) does not match the actual week number (34) returned by the `getWeek()` method of the `Week` class.\n\nTo better understand the issue, let's examine the code snippet for the `Week` class and its constructor:\n\n```java\npublic Week(Date date, TimeZone timeZone) {\n    this.date = date;\n    this.timeZone = timeZone;\n    calculateWeekNumber();\n}\n\nprivate void calculateWeekNumber() {\n    // ...
