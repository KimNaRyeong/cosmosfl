The expected color is blue (R=0, G=0, B=255), but the actual color returned was red (R=255, G=0, B=0).\n\n*  The assertion failure (`assertEquals`) occurs because the `getOutlinePaint()` method of the `ValueMarker` object is returning a value different from what the test anticipates.\n\n\n\nLooking at the line number where the error occurs in the test code (line 297), we can infer that the test expects the outline paint color to be blue, but it's actually red.  \n\nTherefore, the bug likely lies within the implementation of `ValueMarker`'s constructor or its `getOutlinePaint()` method. It seems that the outline paint color is not being correctly set or retrieved.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like me to explore further by examining the code for those methods.\n"
